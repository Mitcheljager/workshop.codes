# Workshop.codes

This is the repository for the Overwatch Workshop Website [workshop.codes](https://workshop.codes). Anyone is free to contribute or submit issues or requests regarding the website.

This website uses Ruby on Rails 6.0 and Elasticsearch. It's hosted on Heroku, using Bonsai for Elasticsearch.

The HTML and SCSS are structured according to [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/).
JS does not follow any direct guidelines. Functions should be concise and limited. Files should be separated by their intent. No frameworks or libraries are used.
Images should be losslessly compressed. SVG and WebP should be used wherever possible.

## Setup

Follow [this Wiki page](https://github.com/Mitcheljager/workshop.codes/wiki/Local-Development:-Setup) to get started.

## Environment vars

Create `config/local_env.yml`
There's several Environment vars that are required for some parts of the website. All of these are optional. These are:

- `SENDGRID_USERNAME` - Your Sendgrid Username for sending emails
- `SENDGRID_PASSWORD` - Your Sendgrid Password for sending emails
- `LOCKBOX_MASTER_KEY` - Lockbox Master key to encrypt email addresses (Run `Lockbox.generate_key` to generate a key)
- `BLIND_INDEX_MASTER_KEY` - Lockbox Blind index master key to search encrypted database fields (use `ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` during testing)-
- `BNET_KEY` - Battle.net key for OAuth
- `BNET_SECRET` - Battle.net secret for OAuth
- `DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_KEY` - DigitalOcean Spaces Key for image upload
- `DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_SECRET` - DigitalOcean Spaces Secret for image upload
- `DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_REGION` - DigitalOcean Spaces Region for image upload
- `DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_BUCKET` - DigitalOcean Spaces Bucket for image upload
- `DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_ENDPOINT` - DigitalOcean Spaces Endpoint for image upload
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` - Discord Client ID for OAuth
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` - Discord Client Secret for OAuth
- `DISCORD_REQUEST_URI` - Discord Request URI for OAuth
- `DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBHOOK_URL` - Discord webhook URL for new/updating Posts
- `DISCORD_REPORTS_WEBHOOK_URL` - Discord webhook URL for submitting Reports
- `DISCORD_BUGSNAG_WEBHOOK_URL` - Discord webhook for Bugsnag errors
- `BONSAI_URL` - Used for ElasticSearch. When running ElasticSearch on your dev environment this can be any random string and it will assume you have ElasticSearch running.

## Rake tasks

There are several rake tasks you can use to make development a little closer to production.

- `rake compress_impressions` generates user and post analytics. Click around the website before hand to generate impressions and events.
- `rake hotness:set_hotness_for_posts` sets the `hotness` or "On Fire" score for posts. This is based on impressions, events and favorites. To get useful data out of this, use the website at random before running this task.
- `rake generate_wiki_articles` to populate the Wiki with Workshop documentation\
- `rake create_search_indexes` to create indexes for ElasticSearch

## Debugging

### VSCode

There are 3 main launch tasks: Rails Server, Vite Dev Server, and Chrome.
You can run all of them via the compound task "All".

- The Ruby tasks require the [VSCode rdbg Ruby Debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KoichiSasada.vscode-rdbg), which requires you to install the `debug` gem like so:

  ```bash
  gem install debug
  ```

  - If you only care about debugging client code, you can run the task commands on separate terminals instead.

- The Chrome task is set up to work with Source Maps, so setting breakpoints through VSCode *should* work.
