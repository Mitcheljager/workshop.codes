<h1 class="heading">Privacy Policy for <strong>Workshop.codes</strong></h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: June 18th, 2022</em></p>

<p>This page details the data we collect, what we do with collected data, how long we keep that data, and how you can request the deletion of said data.</p>

<p><strong><u>Long story short</u></strong>, we keep data collection to a minimum and keep it as impersonal as possible. The only personally identifiable information we collect is email addresses. Providing an email address is always optional, and the email address is encrypted before being stored. However, we rely on third parties to power or enhance your experience on Workshop.codes, and those third parties aren't fully controlled by us.</p>

<h2 class="mt-1/1" id="data-we-collect">Data We Collect and How We Use It</h2>

<p>When you visit Workshop.codes you are given a token to identify you (hereafter referred to as the <strong>visitor token</strong>). The visitor token is completely anonymous, cannot be used to identify you personally, and expires after 4 hours of inactivity. Visitor tokens are saved in our database for a maximum of 1 month. An anonymized IP address is saved along with this token. For more information about how we anonymize IP addresses, please read the <%= link_to "Ahoy README", "https://github.com/ankane/ahoy#ip-masking", target: "_blank", rel: "noreferrer noopener" %>.<br></p>

<p>We also track certain actions you perform on Workshop.codes (hereafter referred to as <strong>action data</strong>). Action data are tied to your visitor token and contain no information that could personally identify you. Action data are stored in our database for a maximum of 1 month. We use action data for analytics that are shown to users of this website. For example, action data might be used to show how many visits a specific page has received. Analytics utilizing action data are always shown in aggregate, meaning users cannot identify the visitor tokens involved in action data, let alone the users to which action data are tied.</p>

<p>When you create an account, only the information we ask for is saved. Your username is public. Your password is encrypted before being stored. The use of an email address is completely optional, and provided email addresses are encrypted before being stored. The encryption of email addresses and passwords prevents this data from being read in the event of a data breach without the attacker also compromising the systems which encrypt said data.</p>

<p>Data that are removed from our live database may still exist in backups for up to 6 months.</p>



<h2 class="mt-1/1" id="log-files">Log Files</h2>

<p>Workshop.codes follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. Most hosting companies do this as a part of the hosting services' analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, date and time, and referring/exit pages. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. These log files are not saved by us personally but may be saved by third parties.</p>



<h2 class="mt-1/1" id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>Like any other website, Workshop.codes uses cookies. These cookies are used to store information including user preferences and the pages on the website that a user accessed.
